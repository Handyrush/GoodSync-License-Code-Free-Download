This multi-task application actively detects changes and continuously synchronizes monitored files according to the specified configurations without any user interaction. Because GoodSync keygen runs silently in the background and performs the entire backup functions on a scheduled basis. The interesting thing is that it takes less time to back up large files and most importantly does not involve risks.
